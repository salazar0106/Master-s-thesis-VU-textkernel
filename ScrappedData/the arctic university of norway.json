Through the two-year program, important theoretical preliminaries such as applied mathematics, digital system and signal theory, embedded systems, navigation and automatic control are covered, as well as more specialized topics on system identification, artificial intelligence, and modeling, guidance and control. Through a multidisciplinary program, students learn the relevant methods and skills in various technological fields, with a commonality through its application in aerospace-related systems. The program involves lectured courses, as well as a high degree of problem-based education (i.e. learning by doing), where the students spend their time working on relevant projects under supervision of a highly qualified staff. The project topics are chosen from ongoing internal research projects, as well as national and international aerospace related projects that UiT participates in. Therefore, several projects has ended in results at a high international level, published in international scientific journals. The students have also been able to present their results for international audiences at scientific conferences and workshops. In the last few years, such projects have included: Attitude determination and control system design for the European Student Earth Orbiter (ESEO) and European Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO) spacecraft under the SSETI-project initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA). To provide a high-quality education with relevance to industry, UiT is cooperating with the national universities in Oslo (UiO), Bergen (UiB), Trondheim (NTNU), as well as European Space Agency, Norwegian Space Centre and the Norwegian Centre for Space-related Education (NAROM).

The thesis assignment is formulated by the supervisor, individually or after discussion with the student and/or external participants. The institute offers a wide range of project assignments within relevant and pertinent topics, based on internal or external research activities, but the student may also suggest assignments based on their own interests or according to requests from the industry. The assignments may also be extensions of project works completed previously in the study, however, with broadened problem definitions.  The project assignment may in general contain both theoretical and practical elements, such as mathematical modelling, system analysis, theoretical derivations, programming, and practical development. The project is individual, and the work should be performed at UiT - Campus Narvik. If the project assignment is formulated in collaboration with a specified external partner, it is possible to arrange for the student to work at the partner\u2019s location for parts of the project period.

Objectives of the course                                           The goal of the master thesis project gives the student competence to carry out an individual project within a selected topic that is relevant and pertinent to the master programme. The student will acquire a broad knowledge of the topic through literature surveys of previous work within the field and related fields as well as a profound knowledge through solving a specified problem. The final result of the project is a scientific report (thesis) containing a presentation of the problem itself, the suggested solution and a discussion of employed techniques and the results.   After passing the course, a successful student has gained the following learning outcome.   Knowledge and understanding:    Advanced knowledge within the academic field of some applied mathematics, physics and engineering, and specialized insight in a limited area within the field of computer science  Knowledge of different theories and methods in the field of computer science  Understand how to apply some knowledge to new areas within the academic field of numerical and analytical calculations, computations, simulations, systematic design process, computational methods, artificial intelligence, geometric modeling, computational geometry, computer science  Can solve academically some problems on the basis of the history, traditions, distinctive character and place in society of the academic field in computer science    Skills:    Can analyze and deal critically with information and use them to structure and formulate scholarly arguments  Can analyze existing theories, and interpretations in the field of computer science and work independently on practical and theoretical problems  Can use relevant methods in computer science for research and scholarly in an independent manner  Can carry out an independent, limited research or development project under supervision and in accordance with applicable norms for research ethics    Competence:    Can analyze relevant academic, professional and research ethical problems  Can apply the knowledge and skills within computer science in new areas in order to carry out advanced assignments and projects  Can communicate extensive independent work and master the domain language and some terminology of the academic field of computer science  Can communicate about academic issues, analyses and conclusions in the field of computer science, both with specialists and the general public  Can contribute to new thinking and innovation processes   As the topic of the master thesis is unique for each task, some of the \"Learning outcomes, skills and attitudes\" points mentioned above may not necessarily be completely fulfilled.

Students will learn intercultural communication theories and engage in critical assessment of and application of these theories with the explicit goal of addressing issues of social justice and ethical self-reflective intercultural practices. The course will particularly discuss intercultural issues in light of a Northern context, where indigenous and national minority cultures are important.  Drawing from historical, social scientific, humanistic and critical perspectives, the course addresses topics ranging from the contested nature of culture and cultural definition; representations of cultures and identities in public discourse; diversity, privilege and power as part of intercultural communication; globalization and modern technological influences in intercultural practices; and the relationship between language, power, and culture. Indigenous and minority culture elements will be central to all topics in the course.  This course will not only acquaint you with theories and research in the area of intercultural communication, but also help you apply the knowledge in order to contribute to the development of ethical, diverse, and more sustainable societies, especially as relevant to nature and culture based tourism and in a context where indigenous and minority cultures play such a central role. You will engage in self-reflection to better understand communication between people from different backgrounds, and in order to increase awareness of how our cultures impact us and our communicative practices.

Here are some of the training opportunities provided by UiT:  Each of the discipline is strongly linked to ongoing research in our research groups, providing the relevant theoretical background, training in state-of-the-art laboratory and field methods, thesis and publication writing as well as training of presentation and knowledge transfer proficiency.  The program has seven disciplines (click on the link for a more detailed descriptions):  Course component  The program has a number of compulsory courses for all students (safety courses, academic skills BIO-3529, data analysis BIO-3012) as well as discipline-specific compulsory components (see the specific discipline for details). For all students undertaking experiments on live animals (vertebrates and decapods), BIO-3503 or HEL-6320 is compulsory. There is the opportunity to apply for courses at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) during the second and third semesters (see a list of relevant courses under each discipline description).  The number of compulsory and elective courses varies depending on the master\u2019s discipline and the sum of courses taken by the student must be at least worth 60 ECTS. The course portfolio taken by individual students will be decided upon consultation with thesis supervisors (see below for details related to the master thesis).  Master students are allowed to take up to 20 ECTS of 2000 level courses. In particular cases, also 10 ECTS of 1000 level courses. Contact the study administration for further information.  It is recommended for students to consider an individual special curriculum (BIO-3805/3810 - 5/10ECTS) with their supervisor on a relevant topic to their master thesis project. It is also recommended for students to consider the course BED-2054 Innovasjon i praksis (10 ECTS, in Norwegian only).  Obligatory Master Thesis component (BIO-3950)  The selection of a master project is done during the first or second semester. You are encouraged to contact teachers and research group members within your discipline as soon as possible to discuss available projects and opportunities and find a master project and supervisor during the first two semesters of the MSc. Information on available MSc projects can also be found through internal communication channels for program students once admitted to the program.  You may start working on a 60 ECTS thesis already in the first, second or (latest) third semester, depending on your own availability and the character of the project.  It is possible to conduct part or the entire master project work in collaboration with external organizations such as Fram Centre Institutes, the University Centre In Svalbard (UNIS), or other organizations in Norway and abroad. In this case, you will need to have an external supervisor at the host Institution, as well as an internal supervisor at our department of Arctic and Marine Biology. For stays abroad, please contact the study administration.  Many master\u2019s students in Biology are connected to research projects at the Department of Arctic and Marine Biology (AMB) and other institutes in Troms\u00f8 that carry out biological research and consultation work. You are welcome to contact potential external supervisors at these institutions to discuss potential master projects. For instance at the Norwegian Polar Institute, Institute of Marine Research, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO), Akvaplan-niva and Nofima.

We will also devote time in refining academic English skills, and how to present research data, including graphic and oral presentations.  Moreover, we will discuss important issues such as use of sources and how to demonstrate academic integrity by showing which sources were used so that the prospective reader will be able to locate and verify the same sources. We will also discuss what is considered plagiarizing and scientific fraud (falsification/fabrication of data), and how a good scholarly reputation is evolving.  This course will prepare students for working with their master project and contribute to building a creative and constructive social network of master students at the faculty.

We will also devote time in refining academic English skills, and how to present research data, including graphic and oral presentations.  Moreover, we will discuss important issues such as use of sources and how to demonstrate academic integrity by showing which sources were used so that the prospective reader will be able to locate and verify the same sources. We will also discuss what is considered plagiarizing and scientific fraud (falsification/fabrication of data), and how a good scholarly reputation is evolving.  This course will prepare students for working with their master project and contribute to building a creative and constructive social network of master students at the faculty.

We will also devote time in refining academic English skills, and how to present research data, including graphic and oral presentations.  Moreover, we will discuss important issues such as use of sources and how to demonstrate academic integrity by showing which sources were used so that the prospective reader will be able to locate and verify the same sources. We will also discuss what is considered plagiarizing and scientific fraud (falsification/fabrication of data), and how a good scholarly reputation is evolving.  This course will prepare students for working with their master project and contribute to building a creative and constructive social network of master students at the faculty.

It describes the physics of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, for both water and ice, and how climate change alters them. The course introduces biological communities and key organisms, life history strategies, habitats and ecosystems of the marine Arctic. Coupling between biological communities and habitats are discussed with respect to energy flow and in terms of how physical processes determine the conditions for biota and their productivity, today and in the near future. Students will be introduced to a wide range of examples of system ecological response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean, ranging from microbial organisms to marine mammals, and including biogeochemical cycles. In addition, management regimes in the Arctic are discussed in terms of their influence on the marine system. The course is taught by a large number of lecturers who have their research focus in the topic they lecture on.

We will also devote time in refining academic English skills, and how to present research data, including graphic and oral presentations.  Moreover, we will discuss important issues such as use of sources and how to demonstrate academic integrity by showing which sources were used so that the prospective reader will be able to locate and verify the same sources. We will also discuss what is considered plagiarizing and scientific fraud (falsification/fabrication of data), and how a good scholarly reputation is evolving.  This course will prepare students for working with their master project and contribute to building a creative and constructive social network of master students at the faculty.

We will also devote time in refining academic English skills, and how to present research data, including graphic and oral presentations.  Moreover, we will discuss important issues such as use of sources and how to demonstrate academic integrity by showing which sources were used so that the prospective reader will be able to locate and verify the same sources. We will also discuss what is considered plagiarizing and scientific fraud (falsification/fabrication of data), and how a good scholarly reputation is evolving.  This course will prepare students for working with their master project and contribute to building a creative and constructive social network of master students at the faculty.

The food web framework builds on well-established ecological theory on trophic interactions (producer-consumer relations) between plants, herbivores and carnivores. Recent methodological developments have provided means to study such trophic interactions more comprehensively within entire ecological communities. The food web approach appears to be especially amenable in case of the relatively simple communities in northern terrestrial ecosystem that often are ruled by a few key interactions. Food webs have also recently shown to be a very fruitful way to study the role of human intervention in ecosystems (harvesting and provision of anthropogenic subsidies) and especially the impact of climate change in arctic ecosystems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Objectives of the course                                            To demonstrate how a food web perspective is useful for describing and analyzing ecological dynamics emerging from the trophic interaction in ecosystems.

The thesis assignment is formulated by the supervisor, individually or after discussion with the student and/or external participants. UiT Narvik offers a wide range of project assignments within relevant and pertinent topics, based on internal or external research activities, but the student may also suggest assignments based on their own interests or according to requests from the industry. The assignments may also be extensions of project works completed previously in the study, however with broadened problems.  The project assignment may in general contain both theoretical and practical elements, such as mathematical modelling, system analysis, theoretical derivations and practical development. The project is individual, and the work should be performed at UiT Narvik. If the project assignment is formulated in collaboration with a specified company, it is possible for the student to work at the company for parts of the project.

The thesis assignment is formulated by the supervisor, individually or after discussion with the student and/or external participants. Campus Narvik offers a wide range of project assignments within relevant and pertinent topics, based on internal or external research activities, but the student may also suggest assignments based on their own interests or according to requests from the industry. The assignments may also be extensions of project works completed previously in the study, however with broadened problems.  The project assignment may in general contain both theoretical and practical elements, such as mathematical modelling, system analysis, theoretical derivations and practical development. The project can be individual or group work, and the work should be performed at Campus Narvik. If the project assignment is formulated in collaboration with a specified company, it is possible for the student to work at the company for parts of the project.  Guidelines for the master thesis project work are formulated by the master's Degree Programme - Engineering Design at UiT Narvik.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Objectives of the course                                           The goal of the master thesis project gives the student competence to carry out an individual project within a selected topic, relevant and pertinent to the master programme. The student will also acquire a broad knowledge of the topic through literature surveys of previous work within the field and related fields, and a profound knowledge through solving a specified problem. The final result of the project is a scientific report (thesis) with a presentation of the problem itself, the suggested solution and a discussion of employed techniques and the results.   After passing the course, students will have the following learning outcomes: Knowledge and understanding:   After completing the course, the student:   has advanced knowledge within the academic field of some mathematics, physics and engineering and specialized insight in a limited area within the field of engineering design (K1)  has some knowledge within the academic field of mathematics, physics and engineering and specialized insight in a limited area within the field of engineering design (K1)  has some knowledge of different theories and methods in the field of engineering design (K2)  can apply some knowledge to new areas within the academic field of numerical and analytical calculations, computations, materials, systematic design process, computational methods, engineering design (K3)  can analyze academic some problems on the basis of the history, traditions, distinctive character and place in society of the academic field in engineering (K4)    Ferdigheter:   After completing the course, the candidate:   can analyze and deal critically with information and use them to structure and formulate scholarly arguments (S1)  can analyze existing theories, and interpretations in the field of engineering design and work independently on practical and theoretical problems (S2)  can use relevant methods in engineering design for research and scholarly in an independent manner (S3)  can carry out an independent, limited research or development project under supervision and in accordance with applicable norms for research ethics (S4)    Kompetanse:   After completing the course, the candidate:   can analyze relevant academic, professional and research ethical problems (GC1)  can apply the knowledge and skills within engineering design in new areas in order to carry out advanced assignments and projects (GC2)  can communicate extensive independent work and masters language and some terminology of the academic field of engineering design (GC3)  can communicate about academic issues, analyses and conclusions in the field of engineering design, both with specialists and the general public (GC4)  can contribute to new thinking and innovation processes (GC5)   As the topic of the master thesis is not the same for each task, some of \"Learning outcomes, skills and attitudes\" points mentioned above will not necessarily be fulfilled. Thus, the learning outcome is somewhat dependent on the topic of the master thesis.

The awarding of the joint degree is documented in one Joint Diploma. ln addition, following requirements arising from national legislation, University of Eastern Finland will issue a separate degree certificate to all students graduating from the Programme.   The Joint Diploma with the Diploma Supplement will be sent to the graduate, subject to application by the graduate. Uppsala University is responsible for administering the Diplomas to the student. General description:  Throughout their studies at Uppsala University, University of Eastern Finland and UiT the Arctic University of Norway, NOMPEL students acquire in-depth knowledge of the law on effective management of natural resources, including the protection of biodiversity, and climate change and the energy transition. NOMPEL builds on the expertise at the three partner institutions.    Updated course descriptions for the courses taught at the different institutions are available at the respective institution\u2019s website.    First semester: Uppsala University (UU)  The first semester of the programme, comprising 30 ECTS, is spent in Uppsala. During this semester two themes are addressed. The first is a general introduction to the role of law in the formulation and implementation of environmental policies. This comprises the functions and potentials of different environmental legal instruments and principles, as well as how legislation and legal principles can counteract implementation of environmental objectives and green growth. Students will also learn how international and EU environmental law interact with national law, using Nordic countries as examples, as well as the basic structures and challenges of environmental law making and implementation.  The second theme of the first semester is more substantive and relates to the effective management of natural resources, including the protection of biodiversity. The objective is to analyse the relation between the management of natural resources (forest, water, wind etc.) and the interest of conserving biodiversity, as stipulated in international law, EU law and also the law of the Nordic states. This part of the first semester also constitutes the introduction to natural resource management and biodiversity protection, various subfields of which are subject to in depth discussions during subsequent semesters.    Second semester: University of Eastern Finland (UEF)  The second semester of the programme is spent at the School of Law of the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Joensuu. The university is home to the Centre for Climate Change, Energy and Environmental Law (CCEEL), which brings together around 80 senior and junior scholars specialised in climate change, energy, natural resources and environmental law. At UEF, NOMPEL students take courses, for a total of 30 ECTS, comprising the following themes: climate change law and policy; international environmental law; green transitions; international forest law; international water law; environmental and social impact assessment. All NOMPEL courses at UEF are taught by international experts, providing unique insights into developments in international, European, and national environmental law. At UEF, NOMPEL students also have access to a host of extracurricular activities organised for all CCEEL Masters students.    Third semester: UiT the Arctic University of Norway (UiT)  The third semester is spent at UiT the Arctic University of Norway, Troms\u00f8. At UiT you find one of the worlds\u2019 largest research centres for the law of the Sea (Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea, NCLOS), devoted to teaching and research on the law of the sea and marine environmental law.    The studies at UiT add to and broadens the student\u2019s in-depth knowledge on marine resource management and biodiversity protection and energy and climate change Law. The courses in Troms\u00f8 are taught subsequently and gives a total of 30 ECTS.    The first course focuses on marine environmental law and sustainable use of living marine resources and includes studies on the protection of biodiversity in marine harvesting, in areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, and offers case studies on regional implementation.\u202f    The second course provides students with advanced knowledge of the interdependence between climate and energy, including the implications of climate change law for the energy sector, renewable energy, emissions trading and carbon capture and storage. The course will also offer case studies from the Arctic.\u202f    Fourth semester: The master's thesis  The fourth semester is administered by UiT, where the students must register, though students are not required to stay in Troms\u00f8 throughout the entire semester. Students will produce an individual master\u2019s thesis on a topic related to the subjects taught in the programme. The topic must be approved by UiT, which will also appoint an academic supervisor.    All students are required to attend a mandatory course training students in legal methodology, thesis structuring and writing skills. Each thesis is evaluated and graded by two examiners appointed by UiT.

Failure to mitigate GHG emissions not only compounds the effects of climate change that are already being felt, but can also lead to catastrophic consequences. Melting of sea ice and glaciers, ocean acidification, destruction of ecosystems and species, extreme weather events, drought, famine, diseases, forced migration, and even war are cases in point. It must be underlined that the high levels of anthropogenic GHGs are inextricably linked to unsustainable patterns of energy production and consumption. Consequently, in the carbon-constrained world of climate change mitigation, serious efforts must be made to curb the demand for energy, to use energy more efficiently, and to develop and use cleaner forms of energy. Renewable energy, energy efficiency, emissions trading, and carbon capture and storage are, therefore, key topics in this context. At the same time, given that energy is paramount for the socio-economic development of countries and for the welfare of their citizens, the regulation of the energy sector to meet the challenge of climate change must be done sensibly. That is, it must also strike a balance with sustainable development and energy security concerns.  This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the policy context and of the key legal framework that underpins the intricate relationship between climate change and energy. On the back of an overview of policy concerns and of the international climate change regime (UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement), this course focuses particularly on selected energy law topics of relevance in the context of climate change: renewable energy, energy efficiency and micro and distributed generation, emissions trading, and carbon capture and storage/carbon capture usage and storage. Within the context of these topics, this course also delves into the policies and key examples of the legal framework and other instruments adopted by selected Arctic and Nordic States. This course therefore provides students an understanding of the overarching international and EU/EEA legal framework for energy and climate change, and of how selected Arctic and Nordic States implement said framework.  A detailed list of the topics covered by the course is available hereunder:  1. Introduction to Energy and Climate Change:   Nature of energy markets and the structure of the energy industry;  Energy production and consumption and GHG emissions in general;  Energy production and consumption and GHG emissions in the Arctic;  Energy mix of selected Arctic and Nordic States;  The links between climate change, sustainable development, and energy.   2. The Relationship between Energy and Climate Change Policies:   Balancing energy security, competitiveness, and climate change goals;  Energy and climate change policies of selected Arctic and Nordic States;  Nationally determined contributions of selected Arctic and Nordic States;  Energy and climate change policy of the EU;  The International Energy Charter.   3. The Climate Change Legal Regime and its Implications for the Energy Sector   UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement and their implications for the energy sector;  Offset mechanisms: Clean Development Mechanism, Joint Implementation, and Emissions Trading;  Nationally determined contributions of selected Arctic and Nordic States;  Application of principles of international climate change law of relevance to selected energy related activities (sustainable development, precautionary principle, polluter pays principle, common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, sovereignty over natural resources, environmental impact assessment).   4. Renewable Energy:   Sources of renewable energy (including the nuclear power dilemma);  The role of renewable energy in energy transition towards a decarbonized economy;  Integration of renewable energy into the energy market;  Legal and regulatory aspects related to the development of renewable energy;  Barriers to the development of renewable energy;  Financial support schemes and cooperation mechanisms for the promotion and development of renewable energy (with examples of support schemes used by selected Arctic and Nordic States);  Relationship between support schemes for renewables and competition law;  Regulation of renewable energy under EU/EEA law and implementation by Nordic States;  Renewable energy related disputes under the Energy Charter Treaty and the WTO;  The role of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).   5.

The course provides an overview over the interaction between international law of the sea and environmental law and offers in-depth studies on the conservation and management of marine living resources.  The management and conservation of living marine resources is closely interlinked with the sovereignty or sovereign rights of States over the natural resources in areas under their national jurisdiction, and their freedom of fishing in adjacent areas of the high seas. The introduction to the international law of the sea therefore provides a general overview of the different maritime zones.  The rights and freedoms of States are to be exercised within conservation and management obligations, which have developed following recognition that harvesting living marine resources affects the marine environment. The conservation of living marine resources is part of the obligation of protection of the marine environment, as reflected by the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals.  The course will have a regional focus, providing students a special insight in the legal frameworks applicable in the North-east Atlantic/Arctic Ocean. The Arctic region is environmentally vulnerable and is thus greatly affected by climate change. Climate change threatens biodiversity in areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, and affects marine ecosystems and living marine resources, such as their migratory patterns.   The course covers the following topics:    An introduction to international law of the sea with a general overview of the different maritime zones (internal waters, territorial sea, archipelagic waters, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone (EEZ), continental shelf, high seas and the Area).  The general obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and customary international law to protect and preserve the marine environment.  The interaction between the law of the sea and relevant concepts and principles of international environmental law. This includes the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach, sustainable development, environmental impact assessment and marine protected areas.  Global and regional legal frameworks for the sustainable use of marine living resources with a focus on international law governing sustainable fisheries in areas under national jurisdiction and beyond.  Implementation of the legal obligations for sustainable use of living marine resources by regional fisheries bodies in the North-east Atlantic/Arctic Ocean.  Legal developments concerning marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (the BBNJ process\u2019).  Challenges for international legal governance of the oceans in the context of climate change. In particular, the course looks into aspects of climate change in relation to the management of fisheries; mitigation of climate change and ocean acidification.

In addition, the program provides practical content, including skills-focused courses.  The program affords all students a unique opportunity to conduct applied research with industry, government, Indigenous peoples and institutions on issues concerning natural resource management, consultations and negotiations, and economic development or other governance issues in the Circumpolar North. The program is offered flexibly, in both a part-time schedule over eight semesters (4 years) and in a full-time schedule over four semesters (2 years). These two formats facilitate the involvement of students who have already begun their careers and wish to complement their education with a master\u2019s degree, while also allowing more academically focused students to complete the program more quickly.

The course will give students an opportunity to compare the situation in different countries, in different areas, and for different resources in Northern areas. The course is a venue for students interested in comparing governance challenges in a circumpolar Northern context.  as well as give them knowledge about different historical experiences of colonization and state integration, and contemporary policies and management of selected circumpolar countries. It is a venue for students interested in comparing governance challenges in a circumpolar North context.      Course Content   The course consist of two main parts. The aim of the first, the theoretical and conceptual framework, is to give students necessary tools to analyze different aspects of governance in northern areas. In the second part, the goal is to introduce students to different cases of governance, both to illustrate various aspects of governance and to understand the variety of challenges in Northern areas.      Theoretical and conceptual framework   Arctic Governance   The development in the North, and not least the possibilities for a rapid and radical new development resulting from climate change, has renewed and reframed the interest for the Arctic. As part of the change, Arctic states are developing new policies and their cooperation, and actors outside the region want to be involved in decision-making processes. The aim of this part is to present the architecture of politics and government in the Arctic; the main characteristics, how it has developed, and how it possibly might affect the development in the region. The presentation will have a focus on the Arctic in general, but with a particular emphasis on Canada and Norway.       An age of governance?   The \"governance turn\" originates from an observation that hierarchies, with states at the top as dominant actor, is not a sufficient description of current decision-making. Borders are much more porous, whether it between actors in government, market or civil society, or between different levels of government. Governance structures is not least important when new structures and processes develops. Multi-level governance has gained momentum from EU-studies, and studies of Arctic development has stimulated debates over regime theory and transnational governance. In this part, analytical dimensions of governance theories is critically discussed related to issues like resource management, regimes, and multi-level challenges.     Cases/areas  Large variation and uneven processes characterize arctic development. The governmental framework is quite different from state to state, and prospects and resources vary among local communities and regions. A limited number of cases/areas will be used to introduce students to these sides of Arctic governance. By using cases and not an approach aiming for a comprehensive picture, the goal is to learn from details and specific challenges of governance and next to discuss how to use the experience in new settings. There will a selection of cases by the teachers from main themes like:   Management of renewable resources  Management of extractive resources and the challenges of extractive industries  Climate and energy  Arenas and institutions for Arctic governance at national and international level  Northern governance and Indigenous peoples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Objectives of the course                                           The students have the following learning outcomes:     By the end of the course, students will have acquired advanced knowledge within the fields of different approaches to governance as well as knowledge of the theories of governance and the fundamental operating principles of governance in northern areas.

There will a selection of cases by the teachers from main themes like:   Management of renewable resources  Management of extractive resources and the challenges of extractive industries  Climate and energy  Arenas and institutions for Arctic governance at national and international level  Northern governance and Indigenous peoples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Objectives of the course                                           The students have the following learning outcomes:     By the end of the course, students will have acquired advanced knowledge within the fields of different approaches to governance as well as knowledge of the theories of governance and the fundamental operating principles of governance in northern areas.

It is important for managing relations both with governments at different levels (municipal, provincial, and federal/central) and with groups outside the governmental sphere (e.g., businesses, NGOs).  This course has three goals: 1) provide an overview of the state of legal and political environment on consultation, including legal benchmarks arising from court decisions on the duty to consult and accommodate, and from policy documents e.g. white papers; 2) examine seminal and current research on consultation and negotiations among Northern actors; and 3) provide applied learning experience through negotiation and consultation simulation exercises.     In this online class we will work with three types of material/information:    Literature on negotiations in general and specifically studies related to Indigenous peoples and local communities.  Content related to negotiation and consultation (court judgements, policy documents and videos).

It is important for managing relations both with governments at different levels (municipal, provincial, and federal/central) and with groups outside the governmental sphere (e.g., businesses, NGOs).  This course has three goals: 1) provide an overview of the state of legal and political environment on consultation, including legal benchmarks arising from court decisions on the duty to consult and accommodate, and from policy documents e.g. white papers; 2) examine seminal and current research on consultation and negotiations among Northern actors; and 3) provide applied learning experience through negotiation and consultation simulation exercises.     In this online class we will work with three types of material/information:    Literature on negotiations in general and specifically studies related to Indigenous peoples and local communities.  Content related to negotiation and consultation (court judgements, policy documents and videos).

Part-time students enroll over 4 semesters, while full-time students enroll over 2 semesters.  As part of the course, students draft a thesis proposal and take part in regular seminars, presenting their own texts and giving feedback to their peers. Throughout their enrollment in the course, each student must individually research and write their complete thesis, which is submitted the final assignment for the course.  The thesis provides students with experience in collecting and analyzing their own material and presenting it in a coherent written and oral form.In particular, the process of developing a topic and methodology includes the work done in IND-3012 (Research Methods and Indigenous Research Ethics) and as part of each student\u2019s Applied Research Project (ARP). These courses should be completed before a student begins work on their thesis. Students are encouraged to include data collected during their ARPs in their theses, but additional data collection should also be carried out, as necessary, through fieldwork, archival research, and secondary data and literature reviews.Beyond seminar time, students are expected to consult regularly with their thesis supervisor(s) throughout the process of preparation, research and writing.  GENI students are expected to complete 35 ECTS worth of work on their thesis, the equivalent of more than one full-time semester. This work, however, is usually spread out over more than one semester of study.  The GENI master\u2019s thesis is an individually written research paper of 12,000\u201414,000 words (approximately 40\u201445 pages) excluding the bibliography.The thesis is more scholarly in focus than the applied research project, and should include increased attention to methodology and theory where applicable.Obligatory coursework includes a two-page thesis proposal, written or oral participation in seminars, and a draft chapter for peer review.  Depending on the character and topic of the thesis and the method of data collection, various ethical issues related to research should be addressed. This pertains particularly to protecting the confidentiality and safety of respondents; subject consent; political issues; and researcher positioning. All students should consult with their supervisor(s) about the need to submit their research project to the Norwegian Centre for Research Data and/or USask\u2019s Behavioural Research Ethics Board.  Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the program, there is no set style guide for citations, however students are expected to use the style of their choice consistently to ensure that credit is given for ideas as well as quotations. This should be agreed upon with the thesis supervisor(s) and specified in the supervision contract.

Throughout their enrollment in the course, each student must individually research and write their complete thesis, which is submitted the final assignment for the course.  The thesis provides students with experience in collecting and analyzing their own material and presenting it in a coherent written and oral form.In particular, the process of developing a topic and methodology includes the work done in IND-3012 (Research Methods and Indigenous Research Ethics) and as part of each student\u2019s Applied Research Project (ARP). These courses should be completed before a student begins work on their thesis. Students are encouraged to include data collected during their ARPs in their theses, but additional data collection should also be carried out, as necessary, through fieldwork, archival research, and secondary data and literature reviews.Beyond seminar time, students are expected to consult regularly with their thesis supervisor(s) throughout the process of preparation, research and writing.  GENI students are expected to complete 35 ECTS worth of work on their thesis, the equivalent of more than one full-time semester. This work, however, is usually spread out over more than one semester of study.  The GENI master\u2019s thesis is an individually written research paper of 12,000\u201414,000 words (approximately 40\u201445 pages) excluding the bibliography.The thesis is more scholarly in focus than the applied research project, and should include increased attention to methodology and theory where applicable.Obligatory coursework includes a two-page thesis proposal, written or oral participation in seminars, and a draft chapter for peer review.  Depending on the character and topic of the thesis and the method of data collection, various ethical issues related to research should be addressed. This pertains particularly to protecting the confidentiality and safety of respondents; subject consent; political issues; and researcher positioning. All students should consult with their supervisor(s) about the need to submit their research project to the Norwegian Centre for Research Data and/or USask\u2019s Behavioural Research Ethics Board.  Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the program, there is no set style guide for citations, however students are expected to use the style of their choice consistently to ensure that credit is given for ideas as well as quotations. This should be agreed upon with the thesis supervisor(s) and specified in the supervision contract.

It provides knowledge about and insight into the main methods of indigenous studies and offers a basis for the choice of method in the research project. The focus falls partially on the practical aspects of multidisciplinary research based on social sciences and humanities. Hence, the course prepares the students for the different stages of the research process related to the individual master's projects and give them an overview of the basic methodological tools as a preparation for collecting data.  The course presents the challenges raised by indigenous methodology, especially those related to aspects of the decolonization of research and methodology. Ethical considerations and reflexivity are emphasized in particular.  The course is highly relevant for the programme due to its overarching function.  The course is to be continuously evaluated by an appointed reference group. In addition, an anonymous online evaluation will take place on a regular basis.

We explore the connection between these land- (and sea-) based subsistence strategies and other aspects of culture and identity, including social and political structures, traditional knowledge systems, education, language, and cosmology.   Today, these lifeways and cultures are under threat from a number of sources including: intensive resource extraction (mining, logging, oil), large-scale development projects (dams, transportation), environmental issues (pollution, climate change, conservation efforts), and resource competition from neighboring groups. In this course we will identify global processes affecting indigenous lands and livelihood, including political-economic trends and the indigenous rights movement. We will look at how these processes take shape locally, through study of relevant UN mechanisms, regional courts and commissions, and specific local case studies.

The Sami people in Norway serve as a point of departure for the focus on indigenous institutions, like parliaments, consultations and other tools for decision-making between indigenous peoples and nation state authorities, and tools indigenous peoples can use in interaction with market actors. The course consist of three sections. The first is on indigenous peoples\u00bf political challenges, and how international law prescribe indigenous participation and involvement vis a vis the nation state and how national regulations attempt to implement these commitments. A second part look at challenges for management of land and water, and how indigenous peoples work with challenges facing their traditional livelihoods, like tensions between these and industrial development. The third part provides an in-depth focus on institutionalization of indigenous self-determination by scrutinizing the model of the Sami parliament while simultaneously addressing the differences in institutional development in the Nordic countries.

A workload of about 40 - 45 hours per week per student is expected, which means a total workload of about 1150 hours per student throughout the total working period.  If a student is going to carry out the work in cooperation with an organization abroad, the allocated time will be extended accordingly. The length of the extension has to be decided in each case.  Part I is generally an introduction to the project and counts for 1/3 of the total allocated time. It is normally a literature review especially adapted to meet the challenges within the project as well as to strengthen the competence of the candidates in the defined field. The intention is to provide the students with the adequate background, knowledge, and overview of methodologies and tools for further in-depth research in part II.  Part II is the main part of the work and counts for 2/3 of the total allocated time.  The actual supervisor is normally responsible for preparing the assignment texts for both part I and part II.

Arctic and subarctic landscapes are undergoing rapid change, which makes it particularly relevant to study how natural and human-made changes impact both society and ecosystems. Students on the programme learn to practice on diverse spatial and temporal scales to address changes to Arctic and subarctic landscapes. These changes encompass social, climatic, geopolitical, economic, and environmental concerns. The aim of the study programme is to educate landscape architects who can operate within the framework of a sustainable societal development. Graduates who complete this programme will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to address the design and development of landscapes undergoing rapid change. Students on the programme study with Scandinavian students undergoing a five-year integrated master\u2019s in landscape architecture with three years of primary education at the Oslo School of Architecture (AHO) and two years of specialisation at UiT The Arctic University of Norway.

These practices make it possible to add different perspectives to the spectrum of human activities which impact and form landscapes in the Arctic/subarctic region. These three perspectives overlap with each other and are thematised in the studio courses.  This course\u2019s start point and research work are connected explicitly to urban practices. With a practical focus, it underscores how we actively form landscapes through different practices in interaction with the landscape's specific ecosystem.  Urban practices are fundamentally linked to the city as a phenomenon but cannot be strictly limited to defined city structures or forms of development. In modern societies, where accessibility has, to a large extent, replaced density as a measure of proximity, traditional binaries such as city-country and centre-periphery will often be misleading in relation to the results of contemporary urbanisation processes. These urban practices can therefore unfold across densely populated regions and open landscapes. Not solely reserved for larger urban communities, which there are relatively few of in the Arctic/subarctic, they are equally connected to traditional towns and their transformation through contemporary urbanisation processes. Central to the course is an ecosystem-based understanding of the interaction between urban practices and natural processes. This understanding is essential when dealing with the climatic challenges which are connected to (urban) life in the Arctic/subarctic.

The course focuses on how different perceptions of nature leave their mark on the landscape. This focus applies both to how different perspectives on nature have shaped the development of landscapes over time, and how they unfold in contemporary discussions about land use and major landscape interventions.  The S\u00e1mi perspective on nature and associated landscape practices will be included as a central theme in relation to the understanding of the cultural landscape in the Arctic/subarctic. The course forms a foundation for students to develop a reflective relationship to different perspectives on nature and use this both in the understanding of relevant issues and in reflection over their own landscape architectural praxis.

Permanent sovereignty over natural resources, the no-harm rule, prevention, precaution, common but differentiated responsibilities, sustainability and other concepts all play a role for enhanced protection of the marine environment although they have not specifically developed in the context of marine environmental protection. The course focuses on the international legal rules concerning the protection of the marine environment from adverse effects of different human uses and the sustainable use of marine resources. Scientific insights, new uses (e.g. geoengineering) and the dimension of overexploitation and degradation of the marine environment lead to rapid political and legal developments in this field of international law. This is reflected by the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals. JUR-3050 General Law of the Sea already introduces some of these issues, this course deals with them more comprehensively and places them in a context that allows for an in-depth discussion of international law regulating different human uses of the oceans and their effects on the marine environment.  The course covers the following topics:   General principles of international environmental law, their relevance and scope of application in the context of the marine environment and their interrelation with the general obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and customary international law to protect and preserve the marine environment  The comprehensive approach of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea towards the prevention of pollution, the role of the Convention and the International Maritime Organization in regulating pollution by vessels and dumping, international rules and regulations on other forms of pollution of the marine environment  Sustainable use of non-living marine resources in zones under national jurisdiction and the International Seabed Authority\u00bfs role in regulating the protection of the marine environment in the context of exploration and exploitation activities of mineral resources in the Area  Global and regional legal frameworks for the sustainable use of marine living resources with a focus on international law governing sustainable fisheries in areas under national jurisdiction and beyond and marine mammals  Legal developments concerning marine genetic resources and marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction including marine protected areas  Overview on the challenges for international legal governance of the oceans in the context of climate change (e.g. carbon capture and storage in subsea formations, ocean fertilization, greenhouse gas emissions by vessels)

The course covers the following topics:   The various maritime zones in the Arctic, their legal regimes and their consistency with international law;  Disputes baselines, claims to historic title over marine areas, unresolved maritime boundaries and the state of play on the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf;  Other Arctic-specific disputes, such as the spatial scope of application of the Spitsbergen Treaty and the applicability of Article 234 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOS Convention) to marine areas off Canada and the Russian Federation in light of the regime of transit passage through straits used for international navigation;  The existing international legal regime for the governance and regulation of the marine Arctic for specific sectors (e.g. navigation, marine capture fisheries and offshore hydrocarbon activities) and the mandate and output of international bodies in this regard (e.g. the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements (RFMOs/As), the OSPAR Commission and the Arctic Council);   The adequacy of the current international legal regime for the governance and regulation of the marine Arctic in light of climate change and the increased human activity which it enables or could enable. In case the regime is determined to be inadequate, analyses will be made to determine which adjustments could be made in order to   prevent, reduce and control marine pollution;  ensure sustainable utilisation of marine living resources;  protect and preserve marine biodiversity;  deliver ecosystem-based oceans governance;  safeguard the rights and interests of Arctic indigenous peoples;     For each of these cases, separate attention will be devoted to   The potential role and responsibility of different states and entities (Arctic and non-Arctic) in their capacities as coastal, flag or port states?;  The potential role of existing international bodies to deliver such adjustments;  The need to establish new regional bodies.

After a short introduction to metal ion storage, transport, and homeostasis, the course will progress to a detailed discussion of redox metalloenzymes, particularly dioxygen metabolism. Early discussions will focus on dioxygen transport (myoglobin, hemoglobin, hemerythrin, hemocyanin), superoxide metabolism (superoxide dismutase and superoxide reductase), enzymes utilizing peroxide (peroxidases and catalases), dioxygen-activating enzymes (monooxygenases and dioxygenases), and cytochrome P450. Subsequent topics for discussion will include selected redox cofactors, particularly those present in various copper proteins, cytochromes b and c, iron-sulfur clusters, cobalamins, and molybdenum cofactors. Particular emphasis will be placed throughout on electronic-structural and mechanistic insights afforded by synthetic model systems.

The programme combines lectures in academic theory and method, filmmaking and practical instruction in camerawork, sound recording and editing. The students at the Master's programme follow a set of courses the first two semesters before they travel on fieldwork. Based on this fieldwork, the students write a Master's Thesis and make an ethnographic film. For a complete setup of the programme, please refer to the Programme structure below. The films produced at Visual Anthropology are well known for their quality. Every year several films are selected for international documentary and ethnographic film festivals. The originality of the program has led to a special educational prize from UiT The Arctic University of Norway, and a further award for educational quality from the Ministry of Education.", "Level": "", "Courses": [{"name": ["\"Emne - Conveying social realities: Exploring audio-visual narrative strategies - 10 ects\" ", "\"Emne - Conveying social realities: Exploring audio-visual narrative strategies - 10 ects\" "], "desc": "                                           The course will start with a camera based \"mini-fieldwork\" in teams conducted in Troms\u00f8. The fieldwork lasts for two weeks. You are expected to spend normal working hours doing fieldwork during this period. Screenings of rushes will be organized, where students will view each other's work and have open discussions during which the responsible supervisors will participate.\u202f The main focus will be on analysing the content, ethical, anthropological and technical aspects. Based on your recorded video material, you will start preparing for the editing of a video story of 7-10 minutes\u2019 duration.   The course consists of three parts:   1) \"Narrative and montage\" provides examples of paradigms or recurrences in the practice of storytelling. The basis of film form, montage and the processes of editing will be thoroughly analyzed. Examples that illustrate the history of montage in cinema will be viewed and basic editing language acquired through exercises tackling aspects of rhythm and pace, rupture and continuity.   2) Instructions in techniques of editing will provide an introduction to the use of Adobe Premier.   3) The editing of the video material provides the opportunity to apply what has been learnt to the making of a filmic narrative.

You will get the chance to prepare yourself - both conceptually and technically - to use the camera as a research tool and will be given an introduction to the cinematographic contribution to the production and communication of anthropological knowledge.   The course deals with challenges related to ethnographic fieldwork, both with and without a camera. You will start the course by reading a selected ethnographic monograph, that will be discussed and analysed in common classes with the SOA Master\u2019s students.   The rest of the course will be centered around five selected video exercises that will be explored from technical, film language and anthropological perspectives.   Tutorials will be provided, but filmmaking is a craft that demands lots of practice that extends what can be offered in a limited number of classes. Practicing on your own with the camera and learning from the experiences of your peers will contribute to the development of your skills. Video-camera with sound equipment will be made available for you from the start of the course.   The video exercises will be conducted in pairs. The aim is to use the cultural encounters both within the team and externally in relation to the study subject to learn about practical cross-cultural communication.   An excursion is organized at the beginning of the semester.

By moving between three universities and countries, you will develop international and interdisciplinary perspectives on urban planning and development. You will also become skilled at working collaboratively and imaginatively with diverse communities, organisations, companies and municipalities. Through conducting your own research in groups and individually, you will become experienced in qualitative and creative methods as well as techniques of spatial visualisation and geographical information systems. You will further gain first-hand insights into planning problems and potential solutions.", "Level": "", "Courses": [{"name": ["\"Emne - Arctic Cities Field Course - 20 ects\" ", "\"Emne - Arctic Cities Field Course - 20 ects\" "], "desc": "                                           In this course, emphasis is placed on important aspects of the composition of the urban Arctic, and on how cities in the Arctic are undergoing reorganisation and change in relation to their socio-cultural and spatial characteristics. In contrast to the impression given by conventional images of the Arctic landscape, urbanisation processes in the Arctic are common and widespread. The course provides an overview of urban development in the Arctic, and research-based reflection on what urbanisation means to people in an Arctic context. Conventional urban theory is questioned, as it neglects forms of urbanisation that take place outside the global network of regional towns and cities. In this course, students will be invited to reflect more deeply on issues of Arctic urbanisation, in which the relationship between nature and culture, centre and periphery, and majority and minority cultures is challenging traditional methods and practice in physical planning.   The course involves field studies in a Nordic city. The course integrates theoretical understanding and reflections on regional development with analytical tools to study ongoing processes of urban development in a Nordic context. The focus is on how planning methods and tools are used and combined in ongoing planning processes involving conflict management and resolution. The course will address issues both in relation to the urban core, such as the compact city, cultural heritage, etc., and processes of interaction between the urban centre and the regional periphery. The course materials and syllabus will cover theories of planning and development of cities and regions, methods of urban analysis (e.g. socio-cultural place analysis and mapping), research ethics and insight into planning practice and planning documents.

This is followed by an overview of shifts in interdisciplinary and thematic angles on \"culture in development\", from the classical era of development in the late 20th century to current rather instrumental uses of culture as a result of the neo-liberal turn and a policy focus on integration and smart city concepts, within which privatization and securitization figures prominently. A major focus is on how planning cultures and urban projects in Asian and African mega cities respond to mega trends (climate changes, tourism, youth unemployment, voluntary and involuntary migration, violent conflict, privatization of security and basic services) and emerging and future implications for Arctic cities.

The one-year program opens with Introduction to Multidisciplinary Studies, giving information on the academic standards to be met by the students in their course-work, and goes on to introduce the methodology of the interdisciplinary approach to Northern Circumpolar Studies. Through five courses; Introduction to the Circumpolar World, Peoples and Cultures of the Circumpolar World, Land and Environment of the Circumpolar World and Contemporary issues of the Circumpolar World (1 and 2), students are introduced to a set of basic discourses of the Subarctic and Arctic Regions.The courses give the students a basis of facts and an introduction to relevant theory from the fields of geopolitics, ecology and geosciences, social anthropology and history geared towards northern issues. This enables the students to understand complex contemporary debates on e.g. land-uses and regional development, and to start articulate their own opinions.

Beginning with an examination of the geography, biological and physical systems of the Subarctic and Arctic, it then turns to the aboriginal and contemporary peoples of the region. The history of the Circumpolar World is treated in a broad fashion, to provide a grounding in the events and developments that have created the region\u00bfs contemporary qualities. The second part of the course surveys some of the particular issues facing the region, including climate change, economic, political and social development. This course ultimately is intended to stimulate interest in the circumpolar world.

The plan is regulated by the Integration Act from 1 August 2021.  The plan is based upon the level definition in the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR). The framework defines three main levels of competency in language:  A \u2013 Basic user, B \u2013 Independent user and C- Proficient user These three levels are divided further to levels: A1, A2, B1 and B2. The Study plan describes language competence at levels: A1, A2, B1 and B2.  According to the Norwegian language training for adult immigrants the learning outcomes are as follows: At level B2, participants can understand complex language and can express themselves objectively, clearly and in a nuanced way on a wide range of general topics and topics within their occupation and areas of interest. Participants can express and respond to views and arguments and participate in interactions with a level of spontaneous and fluent language that enables communication among the parties involved to flow with ease.  The objective of the training is for participants to be able to communicate in writing and to write clear, detailed and coherent texts adapted for various purposes, target groups and situations related to most general topics and topics within their own occupation and areas of interest.  The applicant must have completed the general entry requirements for the University. This includes a level of proficiency in English that is appropriate for the main course. There is no requirement for prior knowledge of the Norwegian language.  \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        Degree Name: \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                Application code:  9012 \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        The study is designed for full-time students and requires dedication and hard work due to a very rapid progression.

It will demonstrate a student's ability to reflect and write independently on topics related to peace and conflict, drawing broadly upon the various theoretical and methodological approaches, field activities, seminars and workshops covered in the MPCT programme. The thesis will examine a specific topic in a systematic or social scientific manner and make potential contributions to the understanding of conflicts and diverse efforts to resolve them. In short, it is a student's independent work using primary and/or secondary materials, but written in close consultation with an academic supervisor.     To assist students towards this goal, the course will contain a number of workshops and seminars that offer a practical guide and coherent framework for students to engage with the research process throughout their studies. These seminars and workshops will address the key components of a research design, writing a persuasive and realistic proposal, provide guidance regarding the ethics and safety of their own research, and foster a clear grasp of the theoretical, methodological, practical and analytical issues relevant to their individual research projects.

It will demonstrate a student's ability to reflect and write independently on topics related to peace and conflict, drawing broadly upon the various theoretical and methodological approaches, field activities, seminars and workshops covered in the MPCT programme. The thesis will examine a specific topic in a systematic or social scientific manner and make potential contributions to the understanding of conflicts and diverse efforts to resolve them. In short, it is a student's independent work using primary and/or secondary materials, but written in close consultation with an academic supervisor.     To assist students towards this goal, the course will contain a number of workshops and seminars that offer a practical guide and coherent framework for students to engage with the research process throughout their studies. These seminars and workshops will address the key components of a research design, writing a persuasive and realistic proposal, provide guidance regarding the ethics and safety of their own research, and foster a clear grasp of the theoretical, methodological, practical and analytical issues relevant to their individual research projects. Throughout the course, students will also train to confidently present their research ideas and results in an academic manner.

The thesis is the main focus of the education.The thesis is to be an independent piece of academic research that meets international standards of ethics, scholarship and method in its field. Through the thesis, the student will contribute to the development of new knowledge, and the thesis shall be at a level meriting publication as part of the scientific literature in the field. The thesis can be a monograph or a collection of several smaller research papers - an anthology. Such collections must have a connection between the various components, and the connection must be explained in a summary. The instruction component for PhD students in Science must contain courses equivalent to 30 ECTS, comprising 20-27 ECTS in the field of mathematics and natural science, 3-6 ECTS in philosophy of science and ethics, and if desired, 4-7 ECTS in transferable skills. All courses must be on PhD level (8000 courses). The maximum amount of ECTS allowed for philosophy of science and ethics and transferable skills is thus 10 ECTS.

It will form a foundational support for the individual\u00b4s future development as a communicator of their own Research.

Psychology covers a wide range of topics; examples are the neurochemistry of a single cell, people\u2019s thoughts and consciousness, the theory of decision making in organizations, and the development of cultures and civilizations. The field of psychology is therefore continually evolving and includes interesting interdisciplinary approaches. In the Department of Psychology, we use basic and applied research, particularly within the fields of expertise of our staff, to produce competent researchers with good communication skills and knowledge of how to make further progress in the fields represented by the Department.  The masters program thus builds on the broad foundation of the bachelors degree by delving more deeply into traditions, new ideas, methods and analytical tools in psychology, paving the way for students to conduct and communicate independent research.  This presupposes that students master basic skills in information retrieval, reading and interpretation of scientific literature, and understanding of simple research designs and statistical methods, and are also able to present sound arguments in writing using relevant conventions (such as the APA format) and communicate scientific knowledge in writing, orally and visually. Students must be able to work independently, under supervision and in collaboration with others. Upon completion of the masters degree in psychology, students are expected to be ambassadors for the field of psychology, pursue interesting questions in the field with professional and personal integrity, and communicate results to both professionals and the general public.

The program consists of a master's thesis (60 ECTS) and courses (60 ECTS).The masters thesis forms the core of the program and is supplemented by two mandatory courses in the first semester and four elective courses in the first three semesters.  In the first semester, there is a mandatory introductory course (Psy-3000 Research Proseminar) that provides details of the areas of psychology in which the Department can offer supervision, and of ongoing research programs to which students can link their own research. The other mandatory course is in statistics (Sta-3300 Applied Statistics 2), provided by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. It gives a basic introduction to statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression and variance analysis. The elective courses may be taken in the Department of Psychology or other departments. The aim of these courses is to provide a solid foundation either for the student\u2019s work on the masters thesis or as a suitable complement to the student\u2019s portfolio of subject areas. The subjects offered enable specialization in e.g. biological, cognitive, educational, social or developmental psychology or health psychology. The Careers Center contributes to the program in various ways, such as the \u201cArbeidslivsdagene\u201d career days (every autumn), general career guidance (2nd semester), a course in CV writing and job searching (3rd semester) and a course in interview training (4th semester). The study environment stands out by being small and active where the opportunities for students and supervisors are arranged for close and good collaboration. The academic environment also persists after the study period. Graduated students are invited back to the department every year. Together, the graduates are updated on what is happening at the program and the master's students learn from the work experiences of their predecessors. The department also has a Student Research Programme in Psychology, offering a unique opportunity to motivated psychology students to spend an additional year within the program that is exclusively dedicated to a specific research topic. The aim of the Student Research Programme is to train students in conducting research, which can serve as basis for continuation to a PhD fellowship. Training within the Student Research Programme will be accepted as part of a PhD programme at the Faculty. Therefore, a completed Student Research Programme in Psychology can shorten PhD fellowships by up to two years.", "Level": "", "Courses": [{"name": ["\"Emne - Research Proseminar - 10 ects\" ", "\"Emne - Research Proseminar - 10 ects\" "], "desc": "                                           This course is the first in an integrated series of courses that form the backbone of the entire master\u2019s degree programme (PSY-3000, PSY-3900-1, PSY-3900-2 and PSY-3900-3). In these courses, students will work hands-on every semester in order to develop skills in research (in collaboration with their thesis supervisors), research communication for different purposes and audiences (partly in collaboration with the Communications Services in the Faculty of Health Sciences), advanced information literacy (in collaboration with the\u202fUniversity Library), and career development. Information and quality assurance meetings with the master\u2019s programme coordinator and administrative programme advisor also form part of the academic development component of the series.   The goals of this particular course in the series are as follows:    To begin to prepare students to be active ambassadors for psychology research and the master\u2019s degree programme in psychology at UiT.   To familiarize the new master\u2019s degree students with ongoing research in the Department of Psychology by researchers who are available for supervising MA theses. This creates the foundation for the later selection of a supervisor and the development of a research topic for the thesis.   To prepare students for writing a 10-page research review paper with an integrated writing and information literacy component.   To offer the first of four career development programmes during the master\u2019s degree.\u202fIn this semester, the programme is\u202fArbeidslivsdagen (Careers Day), a university-wide event geared towards helping students think about and prepare for their post-university careers.     To introduce students to the guidelines and procedures for ensuring that they conduct ethical research.   To engage students in quality assurance work for this course, to enhance the functioning and well-being of their class and the master\u2019s degree programme in general.    This is a mandatory introductory course for students joining the master\u2019s degree programme in psychology at UiT.\u202f It sets the stage for their work in PSY-3900 and for productive participation in the entire programme.\u202f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Objectives of the course                                           The expected learning outcomes are as follows:   \u202f    Knowledge    Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:    Understand the goals, structure and methods of the master\u2019s programme in psychology at UiT and its unique status in Norwegian higher education   Identify potential supervisors and projects for their thesis     Examine published research reviews and develop an understanding of their key qualities   Become familiar with the ethical bodies and procedures relevant for conducting sound psychological research   Identify regional and national employers and their potential career relevance   Identify their role in maintaining successful functioning and a pleasant atmosphere in this course, their class and the master\u2019s degree programme as a whole     Skills    Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:    Identify an interesting and relevant field and topic to guide their own literature review   Begin to develop advanced information literacy skills relevant for writing research reviews, e.g.     Practice searching reference databases using \"controlled search vocabularies\", Boolean operators and search histories   Familiarize themselves with various types of reference databases, indexes and search tools, and the types of literature they cover     Discuss how to identify the most important and relevant sources for a review from search results   Consolidate basic reference management skills     Develop a working outline that guides the writer through the main points and sub-points of the text with informative, stand-alone headings   Write a high-quality research review that includes:     a title that is informative and arouses reader interest     an abstract that summarizes the main points of the entire review   informative, stand-alone headings that guide the writer through the main points and sub-points of the text   a compelling introduction that prepares the reader for the subsequent content in terms of its relevance and organisation   a summary of the core articles that captures the main points and addresses the main questions of the review paper   a discussion of the articles in relation to the main questions     an overall summary of the main findings (e.g. strengths and weaknesses) and suggestions for future research   a conclusion that neatly summarizes the content and value of the review    \u202f    General competence    Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:    Serve as an ambassador for the programme with correct information and personal engagement related to the programme\u2019s unique place in Norwegian higher education, and its goals, structures and methods   Engage in intellectual discussions with departmental researchers about potential research projects   Assess the quality of research reviews   Conduct a high-quality literature search for a review paper   Produce a high-quality research review paper on a topic of their choice     Understand the context and responsibility for producing ethically sound work in the field of psychology   Identify potential employers and what they are looking for in future employees in order to begin formulating how the master\u2019s degree work may be of future benefit.

The formal work on the master\u2019s thesis takes place during the last three semesters of the programme, but work on the thesis may be planned as early as the end of the first semester as part of the PSY-3000 Research Proseminar, a course which enables students to get to know and connect with possible supervisors. The student and the supervisor could at that time begin a dialogue on possible content for the master\u2019s thesis and start making decisions for the student\u2019s academic portfolio.   Second semester (10 ECTS)   During this semester, students are expected to familiarise themselves with relevant literature, prepare a specific research topic and draw up an initial draft of the introduction to the thesis. Students will also present their project orally to an academic forum, participate in the annual day-long Masters event with poster presentations and workshop with current and former master\u2019s students, and receive general career advice from the Careers Centre.   Third semester (20 ECTS)   For projects involving empirical data, most of the data collection will take place this semester. For theoretical projects, the work will be clarified in consultation with the supervisor. The professional development component will include instruction on how to write good applications for conference presentations and research funding, and the Careers Centre will offer a Careers Day and a course in CV writing and job searching.   Fourth semester (30 ECTS)   During this semester, the master\u2019s thesis will be completed and submitted. There will be a poster design course, after which posters will be presented at the annual day-long Masters event with poster presentations and workshop with current and former master\u2019s students, and the Careers Centre will offer an interview training course.

Furthermore, students should be capable of evaluate different measures that can improve people's health.  After completing the study, it is expected that students will be able to: It is essential that students learn to apply relevant theories and methods for analysing basic health questions. Emphasis is placed on learning to master quantitative research methods. After completing this programme, students should be able to map disease and health in a population and identify the social factors that affect health. They should be able to assess and initiate preventive health measures, evaluate the impact of healt-related measures and give an account of adequate solutions regarding allocations of resources. The programme consists of nine courses, each of which has 10 credits (ECTS). Six courses are mandatory and three elective, chosen from a list of four alternative elective courses (or can be taken on exchange abroad). The Master's thesis (30 ECTS credits) completes the programme structure to total 120 credits (ECTS). The first year of the programme consists of six mandatory courses (60 ECTS credits). In the third term the students choose any three courses of the four elective courses offered, or go on exchange abroad. The fourth term is allocated to thesis writing. The Master's thesis (30 ECTS credits) should be written on a topic related to the elective courses chosen by the student.  The purpose of the thesis is to prepare for planning, developing and presenting a scientific project in the field of public health. The thesis can be an empirical study based on data to which the student has been given access, or data that the student has collected. It can also be a literature review or a project of more theoretical character.

The main topics are:    What creates health and illness? Medical and social determinants of health, with a focus on social determinants of health, and how the health of the population is connected to social, political and material conditions.  Social and geographical inequalities in health, what they look like, why they emerge, and how they can be reduced.  Different perspectives on health and illness, including the relation between biomedical, cultural and experiential perspectives.  Cultural perspectives on health and illness, related to three dimensions: cross-cultural differences, historical differences and differences between lay and professional perceptions.  Modern western conceptions of health and illness and medicalisation: expressions, driving forces and implications.  The importance of cultural sensitivity in health-related work and conceptions of health and illness in the indigenous Sami population.  Cultural understandings of professional knowledge and the practice of public health.

The first part explores the concepts of efficiency and equity, and explains how the assumptions of a perfect market are violated in healthcare. By applying basic price theory, we discuss how taxes and subsidies can affect our health related behaviour.  The second part deals with healthcare finance, where we distinguish between the alternative sources of funding, and the different ways of paying providers. We analyze private health insurance, taxation, patient payments, with an emphasis on efficiency and equity aspects. We discuss alternative ways of paying general practitioners and hospitals, exploring the arguments for activity based financing and other incentive mechanisms.  The third part of the course explains methodologies of health economic evaluation, such as cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. Various ways of measuring health outcomes is discussed with particular emphasis on quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Finally, we discuss some priority relevant issues beyond costs and health outcomes.

Objectives of the course                                           The candidate should have an understanding of health problems in the world and of the most important factors that create disease and health inequalities (including services) among peoples. Poverty is a major determinant of health, but also the physical (e.g., temperature, precipitation, air and water supply, pollution) and biological environment (e.g., the food supply and its safety, origin and transmission of some diseases) are of importance. A major goal is to explore these aspects through international health and environmental health perspectives. The course will also explore how the health inequalities might be reversed/stopped and what national/international organizations are providing resources and/or services to do so.   Learning goals:   Knowledge and understanding- The aim of the module is to identify the major issues in International and Environmental Health (IH and EH), review the determinants of health, and focus on learning resources and information retrieval skills.  Specific themes: Nature of emergencies: In pinciple related to rapid health assessments and emergency responses using cases and scenarios for the development of skills and understanding. Infectious disease: The primary focus is on the most important infectious diseases in a global perspective; HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; malaria; pandemics; vaccination; the international system for identifying, notifying alerting and containing important infectious threats. Poverty and hunger: To explore the relationship between poverty, hunger, food and drinking water safety and human health, with a special focus of the projected impact of global warming on these.  Skills and competences- The student should be able to explore and assess different data sources and evaluate the accuracy and quality of the different information sources.  General Proficiency- The student should be able to discuss the different aspects of IH and EH with independent and mature understanding and evaluation of the problems focused in the teaching.

Main Global Health topics The course starts out with an overview of current and updated Global Health Status and how it relates to the global health architecture strategies, and initiatives (including Sustainable Development Goals, Universal Health Coverage). The next larger topic relates to maternal, newborn and child health, together with reproductive health and family planning in different settings and from different part of the world. Community- based health care and health care systems/service delivery, mainly in relation to maternal, newborn and child health with focus on the reliability of health-related information. This will range from basic paper based registers to fully digitalized medical registry systems. Different diseases are covered quite extensively, both communicable and non-communicable in relation to immunization and treatments. Global Health Security challenges, current developments and how they relate to leadership, governance and policy. Few things are more important for human health than diet. Wrong diets, insufficient diets or diet related contaminants are covered in a global health setting. Our changing environment and environmental issues related to water and sanitation, air pollution and environmental contaminants - all of which are truly global health challenges.

The Master\u2019s thesis is to be carried out as a research project within the field of public health. It can either be:   an empiric study based on an existing data set  an empiric study based on collecting new data  a discussion of a problem based on a systematic review of relevant literature  a theoretical study of a concept or a model  quantitative or qualitative, dependent on the student\u2019s documented level of adequate formal qualifications in the different methods and agreement between student and supervisor    Note : the MPH program does not provide courses in qualitative methods, and if relevant, a course must be sought for and integrated as part of the elective courses.  HEL-3950 Master\u2018s Thesis in Public Health includes three mandatory seminars:   1st Master\u2019s thesis seminar  takes place each autumn. For the full time students the seminar must be taken during the first semester.  The first Master\u2019s thesis seminar covers following topics:   What is the Master\u2019s thesis  Important milestones in the work towards a complete Master\u2019s thesis  How to decide on the topic for your Master\u2019s thesis  Information on databases, library services and literature search  Use of references, reference styles and reference managers  Research ethics, necessary permissions, and approvals  Plagiarism and use of artificial intelligence applications  Data available for the master projects (the Troms\u00f8 Study, the Fit Future Study, the Norwegian Women and Cancer study (NOWAC), the SAMINOR Study)  Introduction to scientific writing   The students will be challenged to develop an idea for their Master\u2019s thesis topic and find a candidate to supervise their work.   2nd Master\u2019s thesis seminar  takes place each spring. For the full time students the seminar must be taken during the second semester. Most students will at this point in time have an idea for their Master\u2019s thesis topic and a potential supervisor.  The second Master\u2019s thesis seminar covers following topics:   The extent and format of the Master\u2019s thesis  Project description  Contract of supervision  Former students experience with writing their Master\u2019s thesis   Students without a scientific plan will be offered a pre-developed master project and introduced to the supervisor who planned the project and will supervise throughout the project period.  After the second Master\u2019s thesis seminar the students have a home assignment where the task is to develop a short project description (1 page) and find a supervisor. The short project description must be submitted in CANVAS by the end of second semester and approved by the program.   3rd Master\u2019s thesis seminar  takes place each autumn. For the full time students the seminar must be taken during the third semester.  The third Master\u2019s thesis seminar covers following topics:   What is expected in the Master\u2019s thesis  Common pitfalls and challenges  Evaluation of the Master\u2019s thesis  Protocol development  Timeline   As a home assignment after the third Master\u2019s thesis seminar the students must submit a project protocol (please, refer to CANVAS for the requirements). The protocol must be approved by the program.  All students must fill out a contract of supervision.\u202fThis contract must be signed by the student and the supervisor(s). It is the student\u2019s responsibility to deliver the signed contract to the program coordinator by the end of the third semester.   In the fourth semester  students will conduct a master project and write their Master\u2019s thesis. The submission deadline is 20th May. The extended deadline is 20th November.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Objectives of the course                                           The aim of the Master\u2019s thesis is to demonstrate the student\u2019s competency in planning, carrying out and presenting results of an autonomous in-depth study on a defined topic within the field of public health. The student should carry out a research project individually, in collaboration with supervisors. The foundation for writing a good Master's thesis lies within the knowledge acquired through the courses included in the MPH program, including HEL-3950 Master's Thesis in Public Health mandatory seminars. The three master seminars aim to provide students with a practical guideline in planning the master project and developing a research protocol. After completion of the course the student should be able to:  Knowledge   understand how to apply scientific theories and methods to answer research question in the field of public health  justify choice of scientific theories and methods  understand the steps of the research process  identify key challenges in the research process and how to address them  demonstrate a critical attitude to research ethics and copyright requirements    demonstrate a critical attitude to the source material and literature   Skills   to formulate precise research question/s  conduct a systematic literature search within a defined topic as well as summarize and critically discuss the existing knowledge base in relation to the research project  carry out an autonomous in-depth study on a defined topic using relevant scientific theories and methods  defend the choice of theory, method, conclusions, and recommendations  discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the project  write an academic text following principles of scientific writing and referencing  communicate results from a research project in writing and orally   General competence   acquire knowledge and skills that enable to participate in and carry out research projects in the future  act in accordance with ethical norms in the field of public health and research  demonstrate critical thinking  express yourself in writing and orally in a scientific way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ", "track": ""}]}, {"DegreeURL": "https://en.uit.no/go/target/270448/B619AD0C20F1C0C8E040F28156A478F6", "DegreeName": "Theoretical Linguistics - master | UiT", "ProgDesc": "After completing the Master's programme in Theoretical Linguistics the candidate will have the following learning outcomes: Knowledge - the candidate has: Skills - the candidate can: General competence - the candidate is able to: The Master's of Philosophy in Theoretical Linguistics covers graduate level studies in theoretical linguistics, and is to be seen as an extension of work at the Bachelor's level. The programme places special emphasis on the formal aspects of grammar, in particular syntax and phonology. The approach to these disciplines relies on comparative studies of many languages. Students will develop insight into the structure of language, comparative aspects of linguistic research, social and geographic variation, the historical development of languages and language acquisition. At the Master's level, students will develop special interests based on their coursework and will write either a Master's Thesis or two article-length papers. The programme consists of the following components: The two elective ten credit courses can come from any 3000-level course in language or linguistics offered by the groups for English and General Linguistics, Finnish/Kven, Nordic, Russian, Saami, and Spanish. Note that elective courses must be oriented to theory of language rather than practical language learning. By application, other courses may be accepted (e.g. courses in philosophy, psychology, mathematics, and so on), as long as their relevance to the degree can be documented.Interdisciplinary coursesSeveral \"interdisciplinary\" courses are offered, and these courses are assigned a HIF-code in the university course catalogue. Not all of the HIF-courses, however, may be appropriate for incorporation into the programme. To find out which HIF-courses are accepted as part of the Master in Theoretical Linguistics, please contact the programme staff.ProgressionThe following courses are compulsory in Semester 1: HIF-3010 Syntax I, and HIF-3022 Phonology I. In addition students are required to complete an elective course.The following courses are compulsory in Semester 2: HIF-3011 Syntax II, and HIF-3021 Phonology II. In addition students are required to complete an elective course. Master's ThesisThe degree includes 60 ECTS which must be earned either (i) by writing one Master's Thesis (60 ECTS) or (ii) by writing two papers (30 ECTS each). This work is normally done individually, but may be part of a research project being carried out at the Department of Language and Culture (ISK). The topic and supervisors for this work will be chosen in consultation with one of the academic staff. There is no other restriction on the subfield of linguistics that the thesis should deal with, but it is expected that the content be contextualized to reflect an understanding of the relevant issues from linguistic theory. This applies also to those opting to write two papers, but in this case the two papers cannot be in the same subfield.", "Level": "", "Courses": [{"name": ["\"Emne - Syntax I - 10 ects\" ", "\"Emne - Syntax I - 10 ects\" "], "desc": "                                          This is a theoretical introduction to syntax. The course focuses on developing a theory of syntax by proposing, testing and modifying hypotheses. The ultimate goal is a universal theory which can account for both the similarities between and the differences across languages, thus comparison of data from several languages; especially the Germanic languages, will be a recurrent theme. The course starts with the basic building blocks of syntactic structure and the fundamental ways in which they can be combined. It then moves on to examine a series of syntactic phenomena, including basic constituency, selection, tense and verbal inflection, grammatical functions and case, thematic roles, clausal complementation and question formation. At each step along the way, the theory under development will be tested, expanded and revised to accommodate new data and insights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Objectives of the course                                          The aim of the course is to enable students to work independently with the analysis of syntactic data.

It has two aims: 1) To provide you with a critical review of selected aspects of generative phonological theory of special contemporary relevance. This should get you started reading the primary literature critically, as well as carrying out original research on your own. 2) To give you a sound basis in the techniques involved in organizing, presenting and analysing phonological data.  In the first semester our focus is on phonology 'by itself'. Starting with an introduction to the basics of linguistic phonetics. In the second part of the course we will look at evidence for how speech sounds and the processes in which they participate are represented in the human mind. In the third part of the course, we will examine the evidence for the mental reality of higher-level units that lack a firm phonetic basis such as the syllable, metrical foot (the unit of stress), and the phonological word. We will devote a great deal of attention to the way that languages vary typologically. We will see that there are principled restrictions on this variation. Our analyses will be couched largely in Optimality Theory (OT), the dominant theoretical framework today. In OT, the tasks of describing the grammar of a particular language and describing the typology are tightly interwoven.  In the second semester, in HIF-3021 Phonology II, we look at the bigger picture and ask how phonology fits in with other linguistic domains such as morphology, lexicon and syntax. This will also open up for a discussion of some of the critiques of OT as a theory of grammar.

The course addresses recent studies of syntactic differences between languages, with a view to determining universal parameters. We will provide a close look at recent syntactic theory, especially when it comes to the use of these in the comparative study of the syntax of the Germanic languages. Through the analysis of variation within a group of closely related languages, important syntactic parameters will be illustrated.

Tourism must be able to negotiate constantly changing circumstances. Expanding economies enable more people to travel frequently and over longer distances to experience landscapes, townscapes, cultures, and peoples. Globalization and technological developments enable increased mobilities, and thus tourism activities. Tourism developments and growth also challenges sustainability of ecologies in the era of climate change. This study program seeks to provide students with thorough knowledge about how to balance environmental, economic, and socio-cultural benefits and concerns in tourism. Students will address how to meet tourist markets' demands for nature and heritage experiences, without compromising future generations' access to these. Throughout the program, students will obtain specialized insights regarding policy and practice of sustainability; how the tourists co-produce the products and experiences, how tourism is performed and marketed, and how it shapes - and is shaped by - cultural, social, economic, temporal and spatial power relations. The specialized insights should enable students to analyze tourism in ways that provide nuanced understandings of sustainable tourism in a variety of contexts. By the end of the program, students should be able to employ such scholarly understandings in a Master's thesis project, conducted in line with social-scientific and humanities-oriented theoretical approaches.", "Level": "", "Courses": [{"name": ["\"Emne - Tourism theory and the tourist experience - 10 ects\" ", "\"Emne - Tourism theory and the tourist experience - 10 ects\" "], "desc": "                                          This introductory course will focus on deep insights into social science perspectives on tourism and the tourist experience.
